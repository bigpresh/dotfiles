# David P's dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles - config files for various tools I use,
customising things to the way I like to work.

It's a repository here on GitHub so I can just clone it on a box when I start
using it:

  git clone https://github.com/bigpresh/dotfiles.git

Then run `~/dotfiles/setup.sh` to symlink stuff into place, and all is good;
I can then pull changes as and when desired.

It's a public repository partly so that I can access it without authentication,
so I can have a cron job that regularly does a `git pull` to keep up to date,
but mostly in case anything in here is useful to others.

If you do find anything here useful, feel free to use it!  Feel free also to
drop me a mail and let me know that it was helpful to you - if you want to!

Everything here in this repository, unless noted otherwise, can be considered
to be released under the terms of the WTFPL.
